## Introduction

**"Prospects of starting a Restaurant/Bar by inspecting the Borough of Berlin"**

Berlin is both a city and one of Germany’s federal states (city state). Since the 2001 administrative reform, it has been made up of twelve boroughs or districts, each with its own local government, though all boroughs are subject to Berlin’s city and state government. Each borough is governed by a council with five councilors and a borough mayor. The borough council is elected by the borough assembly. The borough governments' power is limited, and subordinate to the Berlin Senate. The borough mayors form a council of mayors, which advises the Senate. It's the largest city of Germany by both area and population. Its '3748148' inhabitants make it the second most populous city proper of the European Union after London. Area of Berlin is 891,1 sq km. Which is divided into 12 Boroughs.
While looking for places to open a business, we need to select the busiest zones in Berlin where a constant crowd is guaranteed. In a city like Berlin there will be a huge competition for businesses. Keeping this in mind, the surrounding of the selected Borough should not have a lot of similar businesses. Analyzing the office areas of the Borough, it is expected that there will be a lot of restaurants.

**The Business Problem can be stated as:**
“What is the best place to open a Restaurant/Bar in Berlin?”
